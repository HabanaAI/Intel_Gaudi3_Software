As we scale to further processors it becomes necessary to separate the project to common
layer that has shared logic between chips, and Chip specification layer suppose to contain
logic that is chip-specific.

Each chip-specific logic must be accessed through its name space. For example:

namespace eager_mode::gaudi2_spec_info
{
    . . .
}
